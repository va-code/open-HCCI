# open-HCCI
An open source HCCI Engine design as easy to retrofit to existing engines as a turbo

The design consists of:
1. Adding a high pressure compressor to the engine(probably low volume)(higher pressure than autoignition temp of fuel)
2. Removing the spark plugs and replacing them with special high pressure valve assemblies
3. Porting the high pressure compressor output to the valve assemblies
4. Electronically controlling the valves to input a set volume of high pressure air to the combustion chamber after TDC.
5. The high pressure air then autoignites the chamber.
6. the gasses exhaust and the valve assembly resets to the predetonation state ready for next cycle.
